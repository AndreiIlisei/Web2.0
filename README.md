# Web2.0

As mentioned in the paper this website will not function as it should when someone will try to run it on their local machine
as it will not have the MySQL database. 

The application can still be run by downloading the repository, open the files with an
IDL(Visual Studio Code.

After which you will have to write in the command prompt "cd api", "npm install" after which "npm start"
cd client, npm install after which npm start

That should have the application run but without an database. 

Below I will post a video with the application running on my local computer where the database is present.
